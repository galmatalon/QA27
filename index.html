	The moment you set foot in Paris, you’ll feel transported onto a film set. Because the French capital has been largely undamaged by catastrophe or war, it has accumulated a wealth of historical monuments and buildings.<br/>
	In fact, more than half of the buildings you see in Paris today were built before 1949. Picturesque parks are scattered throughout each quarter, offering refuge from the urban bustle.
